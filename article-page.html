        <p>A Hoosier cat who became internet famous and helped her owners raise thousands of dollars for homeless pets
            across the state has died.</p>
        <p>Lil Bub, who lived in Bloomington with her owner, Mike Bridavsky, had a rare bone condition that caused a
            deformity in her paws and dwarfism. She only weighed around four pounds and stayed the size of a kitten for
            her entire life. The vet told Lil Bub's owners that she would only live for a couple of years, but she died
            peacefully over the weekend at the ripe age of eight.</p>
        <p>Lil Bub rose to fame the way most internet cats do&mdash;through channels like YouTube and Tumblr. Bridavsky
            began posting videos of Bub back in 2011, when she was still a kitten. At the behest of friends he also
            began posting photos on a Bub blog. Within the next year, the Twitter account had launched along with the
            Facebook page, and by the summer of 2012, the cat-hungry internet was fighting over who had loved her
            longer. BuzzFeed posted about her. So did Jezebel, which called her &ldquo;one of the weirdly cutest,
            Mogwai-looking mother*** cats you will ever see.&rdquo; But it was Vice that touted that &ldquo;we liked Lil
            Bub before anyone else did.&rdquo; (Talk about marking your territory.)</p>
        <p>Thankfully, Vice put its money where it&rsquo;s mouth was with the Bub documentary, which investigates not
            only Bub&rsquo;s life but the larger phenomenon of internet cats, especially under<del>dogs</del>cats like
            Grumpy Cat and Maru. <em>Lil Bub and Friendz</em> premiered this spring and went on to win best online
            feature film at the Tribeca Film Festival. In addition to the doc and the book, Bub (with Mike&rsquo;s help,
            we imagine) launched a series with Revision3 called <em>Lil Bub&rsquo;s Big Show</em>. First guest? Whoopi
            Goldberg. &ldquo;She was the easiest part,&rdquo; Bridavsky says. &ldquo;It was like, &lsquo;Hey Whoopi, do
            you want to do this?&rsquo; [She responded] &lsquo;Anything for you, Bub.'&rdquo; In an episode airing later
            this season,&nbsp;she&rsquo;ll collabo with Kelley Deal&nbsp;of the Breeders on Deal&rsquo;s new single.</p>
        <p>Lil Bub also stared in a book in which she depicted a space cat who traveled to earth to hook up with her
            owner. The book featured more than 100 photos of Lil Bub and Mike and all proceeds went to animal
            organizations across the country.</p>
        <p>In a tribute to Lil Bub posted Monday morning, Mike said she had helped the family raise more than $700,000
            to help homeless animals across the state.</p>
